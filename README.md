# NeutralinoJS Starter App – System Info Explorer

This is a small interactive desktop application built using **NeutralinoJS** to explore its architecture, configuration, and native API capabilities.

The project started as a documentation-following exercise and was gradually extended to better understand how **frontend JavaScript communicates with native system APIs** in Neutralino.
